AI-Native DevOps Assignment 4  

 

Secure API Platform using Kong on Kubernetes 

Context  

Your organization is building a self-managed internal API platform. 

Key requirements: 

APIs must be protected using JWT-based authentication 

Certain APIs must bypass authentication 

Traffic protection must include: 

IP-based rate limiting 

DDoS protection (open-source, self-managed) 

Platform must run on Kubernetes 

API Gateway must be Kong (OSS / self-managed) 

You are expected to build the system from scratch, using AI tools as primary assistants for design, coding, debugging, and refactoring. 

 

Problem Statement 

Design and implement a Kubernetes-based API platform that exposes a secure microservice through Kong Gateway. 

The platform must: 

Use JWT authentication 

Store users in a local SQLite database 

Enforce IP-based rate limiting and IP whitelisting 

Bypass authentication for selected APIs 

Be deployable using Helm charts 

Include custom Kong Lua logic 

Be reproducible locally or on any Kubernetes cluster 

 

Microservice API Requirements 

Implement a sample user service with the following APIs: 

Authentication APIs 

Endpoint 

Method 

Description 

/login 

POST 

Authenticate user and return JWT 

/verify 

GET 

Verify JWT token 

User APIs 

Endpoint 

Method 

Authentication 

/users 

GET 

Required (JWT) 

Public APIs (Authentication Bypass) 

Endpoint 

Method 

Authentication 

/health 

GET 

Not required 

/verify 

GET 

Not required 

 

Database Requirements 

Use SQLite (local, file-based database) 

Store: 

User records 

Secure password hashes 

Database must be auto-initialized at service startup 

No external or managed databases are allowed 

 

Kubernetes & Deployment Requirements 

Mandatory 

Containerize the microservice 

Kubernetes resources must include: 

Deployment 

Service 

No imperative kubectl commands 

All resources must be declarative and version-controlled 

 

Kong API Gateway Requirements 

Authentication 

JWT-based authentication using Kong JWT plugin 

Selected APIs must bypass authentication: 

/health 

/verify 

JWT secrets must be externalized (not hardcoded) 

 

Rate Limiting 

IP-based rate limiting via Kong plugin 

Example policy: 10 requests per minute per IP 

 

IP Whitelisting 

Allow traffic only from configurable CIDR ranges 

Block all other inbound traffic at the gateway level 

 

Custom Kong Lua Logic 

Implement at least one custom Lua script, such as: 

Custom request/response header injection 

Additional token validation logic 

Structured request logging 

Requirements: 

Lua code must be version-controlled 

Lua logic must be deployed via Kong configuration 

 

DDoS Protection (Mandatory) 

Implement one open-source, self-managed DDoS protection mechanism suitable for Kubernetes. 

Examples (candidate selects one): 

NGINX Ingress + ModSecurity 

Kong + ModSecurity 

CrowdSec 

Envoy-based rate and connection controls 

The candidate must: 

Explain the reason for choosing the solution 

Describe how it integrates with Kong and Kubernetes 

Demonstrate basic protection behavior 

 

Infrastructure as Code 

Mandatory 

Helm charts for: 

Microservice deployment 

Kong configuration 

Clean and parameterized values.yaml usage 

Terraform for: 

Kubernetes cluster provisioning, or 

Namespaces / networking / base infrastructure

Deliverables 

1. README.md (Mandatory) 

Must include: 

High-level architecture overview 

API request flow (Client → Kong → Microservice) 

JWT authentication flow 

Authentication bypass strategy 

Testing steps for: 

Rate limiting 

IP whitelisting 

DDoS protection 

 

2. AI Usage Documentation (ai-usage.md) - “Please make sure not use AI to generate this file, it should be as it is.”  

Must clearly describe:
